-------------  Faculty Research Database Application ----------------- 
----------------------------------------------------------------------

The goal of this application is to allow guests, faculty, and students 
to find common interests between each other. The application has 
different functionalities depending on the type of user that is using 
it. All users can search for entries, while faculty are able to 
create, edit, and remove entries.

----- Prerequisites -----

* To utilize the application, the StudentFaculty.sql file must be 
sourced into their MySQL command prompt. This can be done using the 
SOURCE command from MySQL.

* Please add ‘mysql-connector-java-8.0.21.jar’ to your CLASSPATH. The 
jar file is given in the program files.

* Verify that you have added to the CLASSPATH correctly by compiling 
the program. Either use your IDE’s compile button or run ‘javac 
PresentationLayer.java’ in your command line. Afterwards you can 
either use the run button in your IDE or run ‘java PresentationLayer’
in your command line. 

----- Using The Application -----

* Users will start the application by running the PresentationLayer.java 
file. The user will be prompted to provide login credentials for their 
localhost database. After a successful connection to their local 
database, the user will then be prompted to login with their 
application credentials. Each user will have their own user type: 
“Student”,”Faculty”, or “Guest.” Depending on their user type, they 
will have access to different functionality. 

* To login to the Guest account, the user can simply use the "Guest"
button, and the fields will auto fill with guest login info.

* To login to a Student account for grading purposes we have created 
an account with a username of "aSmith" and a password of “test1211”.

an account with a username of “jHabermas” and a password of “test123”.
